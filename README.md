# WebsiteWatch

Quick AWS Lambda written in Rust in order to notify me when a website has updated rather than having me check once a day and spam F5. Also a way to get my feet wet in Rust.

Abandoned, perhaps forever, bc I don't feel like spending $2/mo maintaining an AWS origination identity for this + the website I wanted to watch told me when they're going to update so I'll stop hitting F5.
